    <h3>It's time to heed the call.</h3>
    <p class="skill-p">
      For years, I flirted with software develoment but never committed to learning it properly.
      I've spent countless hours, days, and weeks building websites for friends and family⁠⁠. I always enjoyed it, and I always wished I had taken
      another path in life. So, I stopped wishing and started learning.

    <h3>Join me along the way!</h3>
    <p class="join-me">
      I will be coding day and night at the Skill Distillery. Follow me as I blog through a 16 week bootcamp on Java, Java Libraries,
      Object-Oriented Programming, JSP, Servlets, Spring, Spring MVC, JavaScript, Angular, SQL, RESTful web services, and more.
      It's going to be intense and will require an abundant supply of coffee. But it's worth it! I will
      push at least one blog post daily, so I hope you come back for more.

    <h2>Get In Touch!</h2>
    <p>
      Feel free to say hello anytime. I'd be happy to hear from you.
    </p>
    <p class="outro">
      The bootcamp runs from September 9th, 2019 till January 9th, 2020.
      I will continue this blog well beyond the course and update it accordingly.
