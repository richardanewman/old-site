    <h2>23:20</h2>
      <p>It’s 23:20 as I type this blog. If you’re unfamiliar with “military” time like most Americans, 23:20 is simply 11:20pm. Europeans
        and I assume virtually everyone else around the world are familiar with the 24 hour clock. It’s not “military” time in other
        countries but rather the hours of the day. The reasons behind our decision to start the count over after noon is another article altogether.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is no confusion with the 24 hour clock—if you are acquainted with it. After 12 noon, you simply continue counting: 13, 14, and so on.
          Moreover, if you are used to the 24 hour clock, having to deal with AM and PM can be even more confusing. You don’t have to ask your friend to clarify,
        “did you mean that you want to meet at 9am or 9pm?” It is 9 or 21. It is simple and it’s clear—just like a ternary conditional operator. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="code-block">booleanExpression ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yes, I rolled an intro on the 24 hour clock into the much debated ternary conditional operator. But I feel like the they are similar.
          If you’re not familiar with using a 24 hour clock, it can be confusing. You have to start doing all the math in your head to figure
          out that 21 is really 9pm. You are not accustomed to associating 21 with your nightly routine or your favorite sitcom. It’s unfamiliar
          and confusing just like a ternary operator to someone who rarely uses it or comes across it their daily work. </p>
          <br>
          <img class="post-img "src="images/ternary.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <p>But I like it. It’s simple and elegant. But if overused, it can genuinely be confusing and hard to debug. For short expressions or
            to bring much needed clarity to a short IF/ELSE, I say go for the ternary operator. Embrace it early in your learning, and it won’t
            feel so clumsy later in your career—like a 24 hour clock. 11 September 2019</p>

    <h2>Blogging Is Hard</h2>
      <p>My hat is off to all the full time bloggers. It's tough to write quality content, especially quality content that people actually want
        to read. I've been trying to come up with a topic all day. Once again, it’s 10:40pm and all you get is a blog post about my lack of
        creativity on creating a blog post. I would prefer to write a well thought out and thoroughly researched post related to today’s
        activities in class, but we are still reviewing java fundamentals and posts on fundamentals are a dime a dozen. Nevertheless,
        I will leave you with a short (and I mean short) reminder on IF/ELSE vs ELSE IF statements just in case someone new to programming
        has somehow-miraculously-found their way to this blog. </p>
        <br>
        <img class="post-img" src="images/if-else.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>In the first image above, there are two IF statements followed by an ELSE. The program evaluates the first IF statement, finds it to
          be true, then executes the code inside the curly brackets. It then moves on to check the next IF statement, finds it to be false and
          moves down to the ELSE and executes the code inside the ELSE statement. This happens because the ELSE statement associated with the
          previous IF statement and only the previous IF statement.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the example above, the desired outcome was to evaluate the salary and only print one of the statements. Preferably, we would like
          the last print line NOT to execute, especially if the salary was $10,000 above our highest desired salary. If you were hoping to execute
          one statement and one statement only, then we need to change the second conditional to an ELSE IF statement, as shown in the image
          below. This will execute only one statement. Of course, there is a path to not print any statement at all. Can you find it? Someday
          soon I’ll have the ability to take comments but for now try finding it on your own. It’s easy. 10 September 2019</p>

    <h2>First Step</h2>
      <p>Day 1 is officially over. It's nearly midnight (10:24pm to be exact), and I've been up since 6 this morning.
       If this was any other line of work, I'd probably be exhausted. But I'm not even tired.
       In fact, I'm excited and already looking forward to class in the morning. Granted I will
       probably have to switch my blogging times to the morning or midday because trying to
       squeeze in a recap on the day while your two year old daughter is slamming her baby shark toy
       against the coffee table just doesn't work. But I love little noise machine.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Overall, today was probably the easiest day of the course. The instructors made it clear that each day will get progressively harder going forward.
       Skill Distillery may in fact be the most intense bootcamp out there, especially for enterprise developers. Five weeks from now, we will be taking four prep tests
       to gauge our ability to sit for Oracle's OCP exam. I'm told that's equivalent to cramming 2-3 years of programming into 5 weeks. Firehose, anyone?
       But that's exciting to me and more proof that I'm on the right path.
       </p>
      <br />
      <p>So, first day is done, and so is this blog post. I don't plan to continue in this fashion but wanted to stick to the plan:
        at least one git push to the blog daily, even if it's only a small update. I'd like to start writing more technical posts, but
        I will do that once I finish setting up this blog to post a little more dynamically. 9 September 2019
