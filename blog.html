    <h2>First Step</h2>
      <p>Day 1 is officially over. It's nearly midnight (10:24pm to be exact), and I've been up since 6 this morning.
       If this was any other line of work, I'd probably be exhausted. But I'm not even tired.
       In fact, I'm excited and already looking forward to class in the morning. Granted I will
       probably have to switch my blogging times to the morning or midday because trying to
       squeeze in a recap on the day while your two year old daughter is slamming her baby shark toy
       against the coffee table just doesn't work. But I love little noise machine.</p>
       <br />
      <p>Overall, today was probably the easiest day of the course. The instructors made it clear that each day will get progressively harder going forward.
       Skill Distillery may in fact be the most intense bootcamp out there, especially for enterprise developers. Five weeks from now, we will be taking four prep test
       to gauge our ability to sit for Oracle's OCP exam. I'm told that's equivalent to cramming 2-3 years of programming into 5 weeks. Firehose, anyone?
       But that's exciting to me and more proof that I'm on the right path.
       </p>
      <br />
      <p>So, first day is done, and so it this blog post. I don't plan to continue in this fashion but wanted to stick to the plan:
        at least one git push to the blog daily, even if it's only a small update. I'd like to start writing more technical posts, but
        I will do that once I finish setting up this blog to post a little more dynamically.</p>
